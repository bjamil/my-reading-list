# Course Intro

* Supervised learning
* Have some benefits over Neural Networks: 
	* Easier to configure
	* Have good defaults
	* Fewer hyperparpameters
	* Require less data preprocessing (e.g. one hot encoding)
	* Faster inference than similarly sized NNs 
	* Good results out of the box; used in many ML competitions
	* "Sample Efficient" - can train on small datasets or on datasets with high feature to example ratio
* Used in: Classification, Regression, Ranking, Uplift Modeling
* Good to use on structured/tabular data. Don't use on unstructured data. NNs are better for those
